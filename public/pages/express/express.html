                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                Express is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js".<br>
                Express can be used to create web applications or create APIs and is perhaps the most used Node.js server framework.
                Express is a Node.js module and can as such be installed through the node package manager (npm).<br>
                This is done by running the <code>npm install express</code> command.<br>
                Alternatively one could add the dependency to the package.json file and simply run <code>npm install</code>
                to install any uninstalled dependencies.

                <h3>Why Express?</h3>
                It is used for designing and building web applications quickly and easily . Web applications are web apps that you can run on a web browser. Since Express. js only requires javascript, it becomes easier for programmers and developers to build web applications and API without any effort.

            <p class="getstarted-class">
                <h3>Getting started</h3>
                To get started using express in our project we need to import express module by using <code>const express = require('express')
                </code> then we can create the server <code>
                    const app = express()</code>.
            </p>
            </section>
            </section>
            <section id="port">
            <p class="port-class">
                <h3>Listening port </h3>
               After initializing the server we need to assign the port so that server can be assesed by mentioning that port.
               <code> app.listen(3000,()=>{console.log("server is running at portnumber "+ 3000)})</code>.<br>
               There could be the different ports for production and development environment. We can assign port with fallback port.
               <code>const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;</code>. Here the port number 3000 is fallback port, If the server
               can not find the assigned port it just use the fallback port.
            </p>
            </section>
            <section id="env">
            <p class="env-class">
               <h3>Environment variables</h3>
               In the realworld scenario, there are several stages of code writing such as development stage,testing stage and production stage. 
               For every stage it is better to assign the server port separately.But hard coded port are not easy to handle so that we use the environmental variables.
               Environment variables are a fundamental part of developing with Node.js, allowing your app to behave differently based on the environment you want them to run in. 
               Wherever your app needs configuration, you use environment variables. <br>
               <code>const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;</code>. <br>

            <p class="cross-env-class">
                <h3>Cross-env</h3>
            While working in a big company. There are several developer,tester and designer. They use different computer with 
            different environments. Using the environment variable and managing it according to their environment is painful. But cross-env npm package will help us to get rid of that pain.
            This package allows environment variables to be set in one way for every platform.To install this package we use <code>npm install --global cross-env</code>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    {
                        "scripts": {
                          "start-dev": "cross-env PORT=3000 nodemon app.js",
                          "start": "node app.js"
                        },
                        "dependencies": {
                          "express": "^4.17.2"
                        },
                        "devDependencies": {
                          "cross-env": "^7.0.3"
                        }
                      }
                </code>
            </pre>
            After installing it, we could see the cross-env in our package.json. After that we can add the cross-env in script.
            <pre>
                <code>
                    "scripts": {
                        "start-dev": "cross-env PORT=3000 nodemon app.js",
                        "start": "node app.js"
                      },
                </code>
            </pre>

                <h3>Json parser</h3>
                In order to be able to parse json in express you must configure it through the "app" object.<br>
                This can be done in a simple line:<br>
                <code>app.use(express.json())</code><br>
                This is important to do when creating REST apis. Without it express won't be able to parse json requests
                and so you will not be able to use data recieved through requests using GET, PUT etc.
             
            </p>

            <section id="endpoint">
            <p class="endpoint-class">
                <h3>Endpoints</h3>
                Endpoints are a way of defining an "access point" for a client to communicate with the express server.
                                An endpoint consists of a URI and a specific HTTP request method
                                like <code>GET</code> <code>POST</code> and
                                so on.
            
                                Endpoints are created by calling the HTTP specific verb on the app variable:<br><br>
                                <code>app.get</code><br>
                                <code>app.put</code><br>
                                <code>app.delete</code><br>
                                and so on...<br><br>
            
                                An endpoint will take the arguments of a path and a callback.<br><br>
                                In the callback you provide the parameter "req" and "res" which can be used to interact with the
                                incoming request or the outgoing response.<br>
                  
                </p>
            </section>
            <section id="req-res">
                <p class="req-res-class">
                    <h3>Request and response</h3>
                         Request and Response object both are the callback function parameters and are used for Express.js and Node.js. You can get the request query, 
                         params, body, headers, and cookies. It can overwrite any value or anything there. However, overwriting headers or cookies will not affect the output back to the browser.
                        Through the request it is possible to interact with an incoming query string,
                        and through the response it is possible to send it back to the client as a string.<br><br>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            app.get("/express", (req, res) => {
                                res.send(expressPage);
                            });
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                        <h3>Static content</h3>
                        "Static content is any content that can be delivered to an end user without having to be generated,
                                modified, or processed."<br><br>
                                Static content can be html pages, images or files.<br><br>
            
                                The client is by default not allowed to access server files in express. Therefore the server must be
                                configured to allow this.
                                This is done by telling the server to allow a specific directory (and sub-directories) to be served <br><br>
                          <code>
                            app.use(express.static("public"));
                          </code>
